# Bill Tracker
A simple MAUI app which you can use to track your bills.

I foresee this to alert you in X no. of days before one of your bills are due. This also requires you to religiously enter your bills here as they arrive.

It's a simple app, but it should replace your Excel spreadsheet, if you have one.

Looking for collaborators. I'm looking forward to launch this on Android, iOS and even on Windows.

## Deployment

To debug, just download the latest Visual Studio, open the SLN file and just debug on Windows if you're a noob on MAUI. Otherwise, you may also debug in Android or iOS.


## Roadmap

- Add Bills per Biller
- Show Latest Bill Details per Biller on Main Page CollectionView
- Change Row Color of Biller, depending if Bill is X Days Away from Due Date
- Push Notifications When Bills are X Days Before Due Date
... And many more features to come!
